using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;
using UnityEngine.Analytics;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class AnalyticsScripts : MonoBehaviour 
{
	void Start()
	{
		LevelUp();
	}

	void LevelUp()
	{
		int totalPotions = 5;
		in totalCoins = 100;
		string weaponID = "Weapon_102";
		Analytics.CustomEvent("gameOver", new Dictionary<string,object>

				{"potions", totalPotions},
				{"coins", totalCoins},
				{"activeWeapon", weaponID}
			});
	}
}

NOTE: LevelUp method from Analytics Dashboard
