Fixed Update

*Similar to Update but using physics
*Uncheck gravity on the Rigidbodyvia the Inspector for this

Add a Rigidbody -> to allow object to collide

NOTE: Physics objects move due to force

---

public float force = 5;

void Update() {

	Rigidbody rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody>();

	rb.AddForce(new Vector3(0,0,force));
}



NOTE: Remember -> when dealing with Rigidbodies always use FixedUpdate instead of Update

Therefore:

public float force = 5;

void FixedUpdate() {

	Rigidbody rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody>();

	rb.AddForce(new Vector3(0,0,force));
}

Why?

Update frame can take various amounts of time depending on what needs to be done. With physics calculations physics needs to happen at a regular time interval.

Edit-> Project Settings -> Time:

TimeManager: Fixed Timestep has a value and it can be adjusted
