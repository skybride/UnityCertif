GameObject Components

Ex: 
Create a Sphere GameObject -> Rename it Projectile 
Create a Cube GameObject -> Rename it Target
Create a new C# script -> Name it ProjectileMovement

Thought Process:
In order to move Sphere we need to have access to the gameObject's transform

void Start()
{
	Transform trans = GetComponent<Transform>();
	trans.position = new Vector3 (1,2,3);
}

NOTE: 
Transform = type
trans = variable name
GetComponent = pre made Unity function
<> = Type of component to look for in this case 'Transform'

---

to expose in the Inpsector:

public Vector 3 newPosition;

void Start()
{
	Transform trans = GetComponent<Transform>();
	trans.position = newPosition;
}

---
to use in a method

public Vector 3 newPosition;

void Start()
{

}

public void UpdatePosition()
{
	Transform trans = GetComponent<Transform>();
	trans.position = newPosition;
}

---

[Calling a method from another Script Component]

void Start() {
	ProjectileMovement projectileMovementObject = GetComponent<ProjectileMovement>();
	projectileMovementObject.UpdatePosition();
}
