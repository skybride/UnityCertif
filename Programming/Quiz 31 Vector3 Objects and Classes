Vector3 Objects and Classes

Objects and Classes:

Object: 
-> collection of methods and/or variables

Classes: 
-> Blueprints of values which Objects use

ex: ClassA -> Object1
	ClassA -> Object2
	ClassA -> Object3

If Objects were gameObjects for ex -> they would all share the same blueprints and carry out the same methods or functions.

---
Vector3 variable: built-in Unity type that is an object with 3 dimensional vectors

ex:

void Start (){
	Vector3 currentLocation = new Vector3 (1.0f,2.0f,3.0f);
}

NOTE: Vector3 is the type, currentLocation = name of the variable -> new repersents a new object Vector3 is the new object's type that will require a value for x,y,z

---
(Now if we add Vector3 home = new Vector3 (x,y,z);)
Find the location between

Vector3 locationToHome = currentLocation - home;
print("Distance to home is "+ locationToHome.magnitude);

1. Which is the correct way to create a 3D vector?

- new Vector3(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f);

2. Which of the following is a valid operation on vectors (assume variables a and b contain Vector3)

- a.magnitude

3. In the following lines of code, why do we use a dot?

- To access the contents 'x' of the variable 'a'

4. What data is a Vector3 made up of?

- 3 floats

5. What is an example of an object?

- A component on a GameObject
