Quiz 33 Time DeltaTime

Though Process:

void Update() {
	transform.position - transform.position + new Vector3(0,0,1);
}

---

public float speed = 5;

void Update() {
	transform.position - transform.position + new Vector3(0,0,speed);
}

What units is speed in?
Meter's per second?

---
We need to know the frame rate aka Time.deltaTime

---

public float speed = 5;

void Update() {

	Vector3 positionDelta = new Vector3(0,0,speed * Time.delta);
	transform.position - transform.position + positionDelta;
}

NOTE: 
could have left it:

transform.position - transform.position + new Vector3(0,0,speed * Time.deltaTime);

HOWEVER this is very long to ready
It is better to keep code short and concise.

Set 'new Vector3(0,0,speed * Time.deltaTime);' to = a variable of type Vector3 with name positionDelta

If code gets long extract into variables -> If starts to become too long again extract into a method.

---

NOTE: DELTA TIME corresponds with frame rate.While frame rate decreases and time between frames increase -> movement stays constant because that delta time will correspond to that frame rate.

Quiz

1. Which is the correct method call to get the previous frame time?

- Time.deltaTime

2. Which case requires deltaTime?

- Accelerating by 3m/s every second

3. Where would you do something on every frame?

- Update()

4. How long does a frame take?

- It depends on how much work needs to be done
