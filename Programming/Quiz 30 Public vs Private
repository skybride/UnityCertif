Public vs Private

Public: exposes parameters to inspector and to other scripts

Private: can only be used in particualr method

public float apples;
public float oranges;

void Start()
{
	print ("Average = "+ Average(apples, oranges));	
}

float Average (float a, float b)
{
	sum float = a + b;
	return = sum /2; 
}

NOTE: 'float Average' is a method that does an average calculation every time it is called.
Since it is called in the 'Start()' function with 'float apples;' and 'float oranges' passed in as the arguments.

Average = 0 in the Console window.

Seems strange but if you add Component of this C# script on to a GameObject -> You will notice that there will be slots of the float value of apples and oranges as they were not declared when instantiated.

ex:

public float apples = 1;
public float oranges = 3;

void Start()
{
	print ("Average = "+ Average (apples, oranges));
} 

---
in the console window: Average = 2

1. In which of these areas is it possible to declare a public or private variable?

- B

2. What is the name of the public variable in the following code snippet?

- axisName

3. With reference to the code fragment below...

1 = C : Joystick = Class
2 = D : axesToUse = Public Variable
3 = B : m_StartPos = Private Variable
4 = A : OnEnable() = Method/function

4. Which of these variables is private?

- m_UseX

5. Which line number would be responsible for creating an error?

-  4
