Function of Layers

- Control which objects are visible
- Whether to block Raycast or not
- If the layer is invisble to the camera

Edit -> Project Settings -> Tags and Layers
OR 
Via the Inspector -> Layer: Add

[Culling Mask]

Add a GameObject (like a sphere)
Add Layer -> and call it Invisible To Camera
Main Camera -> Camera -> Culling Mask: Uncheck Invisible To Camera

Sphere should disappear

NOTE: This is good for debugging and for developers to display information to other developers without having it visible in the game.
