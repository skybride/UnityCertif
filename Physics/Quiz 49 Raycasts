[How to Call Raycast]

public BalisticSolver solver;

void Update () {
	var ray = new Ray(transform.position, transform.forward);
	RaycastHit hitInfo;   // type Raycast with name hitInfo
	if(Physics.Raycast(ray, out hitInfo))   //this is the raycast API call
	{
		solver.target = hitInfo.point;
	}
}

NOTE: Raycast returns a bool, hit can either be true or false

- A line is projected until it hits something then it returns that point.

2. Match the following methods to their use cases

2 = D : Static Collider = Scenery which must block physics objects 
3 = C : Trigger Collider = An Area that deals damage when entered 
4 = B : Raycast = Checking if an AI can see the player

3. Click the UI to change the collider shape visually

- C

4. Match the Collider names to their component symbols

1. Cube = C
