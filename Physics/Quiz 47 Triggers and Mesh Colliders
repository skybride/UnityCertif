2. What needs to be true about this collider mesh before it can be made a trigger?

- It must be convex

- Calls the 'OnTriggerEnter()' method on any Component of the current GameObjects, if it exists

4. What are the differences between a Collider and a Trigger Collider?

- The Collider blocks physics objects but the Trigger lets them through
