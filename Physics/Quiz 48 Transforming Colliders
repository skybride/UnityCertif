Quiz 48 Transforming Colliders

[Key Focus]
- Movement
- Composite Collider

NOTE: GameObject -> Break Prefab Instance allows you to make adjustments to your prefab in the Hierarchy via the Inspector without affecting the saved Prefab in the Project pane

Composite Collider: Creating you own collider on a GameObject with multiple colliders

---

1. Which are the scale properties of the Capsule collider?

- Radius and Height

2. How can you work around the restriction that colliders must be convex on this object?

- By creating empty sub-objects with a collider for different sections of the object, scaling and rotating them

3. When moving a collider programmatically, what is important to do?

- Add a Rigidbody and set it to Kinematic

4. When should you check the Rigidbodies 'Is Kinematic' property?

- When you intend to control the objects position throught its transform and not physics

5. What does this property expect?

- A GameObject or Prefab
