Quiz 66 Obstacle Avoidance

Key Focus:
- Nav Mesh Obstacle
- AI avoiding dynamic obstacles
- avoiding meshes not baked in


---
Nav Mesh Obstacles:
Dynamic Object that has an effect on the environment

Nav Mesh Obstacles -> Carve: 
- if checked: carves a whole in the mesh (once the mesh stops moving) allow GameObject to pathfind through it

1. Which component is required to model dynamic obstacles?

- Nav Mesh Obstacle

2. Why might you want to enable the Carve property of a Nav Mesh Obstacle?

- So an agent can find an efficient route around it when stationary

3. At what point will an obstacle carve a hole in the NavMesh?

- A short while after the object stops moving

4. Describe the behaviour of an agent around an obstacle that doesn't carve the NavMesh

- The agent will do it's best to avoid it but cannot route around it

5. Which properties affect when recarving will occur?

- Move Threshold
