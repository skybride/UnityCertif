Inspector

- Active In the Hierarchy -> Check box name that enables/disables GameObject
- Namefield
- Static check box -> Flag to Game Engine for possible Optimization
- Tag -> tag on GameObject to make it easier for Code to find
- Layer -> Restricting interaction between objects. Filtering an operation over sets of objects. (ex. Invisible object perhaps like a bush -> will have an ignore Ray cast layer)
