Sprites

*2D assets 
Sprites Sheets (spliced) with different instances of that sprite.

Go to Google -> Images -> Usage rights: Adjust to labeled for reuse with modification
- Save Image - Drag and drop into Unity
- Via the Inspector adjust Texture Type: Sprite (2D and UI)
- Sprite Mode: Multiple
- Apply

NOTE: Multiple sprite mode allows for splicing

In Sprite Editor:
- Cut out desired sprites
- Pivot point of sprite can also be adjusted

(In top right select slice)
Type: 
Automatic: Unity uses Alpha channel to figure out where sprites are
Grid By Cell size: Counting Pixels
Grid By Cell Count: Counting by columns and rows


NOTE: Background has to be an alpha channel aka transparent (You can use Gimp to adjust this)

Now Sprites can be used
