Click on an audio file and look in the Inspector
You are able to choose build type -> Web or Standalone application?

Under 'Default' there are Compression Settings

- Decompress On Load: Decompress into memory -> uses a lot of memory but restricts the CPU usage (won't affect game play)

- Compressed In Memory: Load in compressed file and when access is required it is then decompressed -> uses less memory. Uses CPU at time of access

- Streaming: Uses least memory of all. Stores a buffer in memory and reads whole file from disk. Stores or uses high speed.

NOTE: Vorbis -> you can change quality

Look up 'Audio Clip' in Unity Docs

Force To Mono: takes two channel audio and makes it into one channel audio
Normalize: down mixing mono often leads to quite audio -> normalizing bring that back up
Load In Background: Helps with optimization (so game is not super slow on load at beginning)
Preload Audio Data: If checked off audio will be loaded only first time it is called to play. (CPU overhead and delay if doing this)

NOTE: You can play an Audio Clip from and Audio Source (component)
