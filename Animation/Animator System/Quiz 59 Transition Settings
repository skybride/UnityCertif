Quiz 59 Transition Settings

Key Focus:

- Solo
- Mute
- ORDER MATTERS
- Blend period

Select in the Animator tab -> Base Layer -> Animation(ex walk) -> From the Inspector -> Transitions: Solo and Mute.

They both have the same affect. The dictate the transition state

[Blend Period]

- Fixed Duration: if unchecked Unity normalizes
- Transition Duration: affecd but fixed being checked or unchecked
- Transition Offset: normalizes start times
- Has Exit Time: checked = gives control when transition will stop if unchecked when ever transition is triggerd it will immediately stop (Animation wont finish)
- Interruption Source: None| Next State| Current State| Current State Then Next State

*Blend between animations to make it look natural 
ex: from crouch to walk -> pace should slow down -> does the feet match up

1. What does it mean for a transition to have 'Has Exit Time' set?

- The transition will happen at an exact point in the animation cycle

2. What does this length of time represent?

- The transition duration

3. What is the unit of measure of Transition Duration when this property is set?

- In seconds * 

4. What is the significance of the order of transitions?

- The first that is possible will be taken

5. State A is transitioning to state B. Suddenly another transition becomes possible too. Match the Interruption Source value to the expected behaviour
*Very tricky

1 = A : None = If state A and B can transition to C, then nothing happens 
2 = B : Current State = If state A and B can transition to C, then A will transition to C
3 = C : Next State If State B can transition to C, the the transition is interrupted
4 = D : Next State then Current State = If state A and B can transition to C, then B will transition to C
