Quiz 58 Transitions

Key Focus:
- Controlling when transitions happen

Parameters:
- Float
- Int
- Bool
- Trigger

[Bool ex]

1. In the Animator pane select the '+' and add a 'Bool'
2. Rename it 'walking'
3. Click on the transition arrow between the Idle and Walking state
4. In the Inpsector pane -> Find 'Conditions' -> select the '+'
5. Add walking and set it to true 
6. Uncheck 'Has Exit Time'
7. Click on the transition arrow going from Walking to Idle -> condition should be set to walking as well but false 
8. Uncheck 'Has Exit Time'

---
Enter Play Mode:

Now in the Animator Tab -> if walking is checked (aka bool is true) GameObject should walk. When unchecked walking should stop immediately (Since Has Exit Time has been unchecked)

NOTE: If 'Has Exit Time' was not unchecked player would have to wait for the full walk animation to finish.

[Foot IK]
- Inverse Kinematics -> makes GameObject look rooted to the ground
Animation action selected (like walking or jumping) -> via the Inspector 'Foot IK' can be checked

[Trigger ex]

Very similar to Bool except in the Inspector there will be no true or false available in 'Conditions'
