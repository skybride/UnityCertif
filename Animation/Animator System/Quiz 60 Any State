Quiz 60 Any State

Key Focus:
- Simplifying by using Any State
- Motion
- Speed
- Mirror
- Cycle Offset

Any State: 
Transitions coming from Any State wil be triggered for any state that they're in.


Speed: In the Animator tab -> any created paramters can be added to an animation (like walk) from the Inspector when it is selected. Check Paramter under speed and the multiplyier will have the new parameter created available (A parameter created from the Animator tab could be for example a float: walkFast)

Mirror: Mirrors the animation

Cycle Offset: Adjusting from which exact point in the animation the loop will start
