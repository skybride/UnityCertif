Quiz 63 Sub-State Machines for Jumping

Key Focus:
- Layers
- Sub-state machines

---
Simplify:
- JumpUp
- MidAir
- Fall
- Crouch(after fall)

In Animator tabe under Layers tab -> Select '+' symbol. 

NOTE: New Layer and Base Layer will run in parallel

---
Layers need a weight for the state machine to recognize which animation to do.

Layer: 
- Weight: 0 - 1
- Mask: Which part of the avatar gets affected ex: arm, leg, fingers etc
- Blending: Override, Additive

---
In Animator -> Base Layer -> Right click -> Create Sub-State Machine:

1. Double click on Sub-State Machine
2. Drag and drop any states that you want to be in the Sub-State Machine
3. When double clicked create a transition arrow from the State back to the (Up) Base Layer 

NOTE: very similar to Base Layer -> Has Entry, Exit and Any State. Difference -> has (Up) Base Layer.

When right clicked on New State Machine -> 2 Options: State transition(white) or State Machine transition (grey).

To avoid the New StateMachine from having to understand sequences that happened from one node up -> While in the New StateMachine -> Transition from state to Exit not (Up) Base Layer. Then on the Base Layer, right click on New StateMachine and make a transition to Grounded. (Transtition arrows should be gray)

This creates simple transitions between entry an exit nodes for state machines and other states. 

Why? We can use this Sub-State Machine to organize all the different animations that make up the jump sequence

Note New State Machine does not require a transition from the Any State or from an Entry State

1. When should you use a Sub-State Machine?

- When you want to simplify a large state machine

2. When should you use a State Machine layer?

- When you want to run multiple animations at the same time

3. What is meant by encapsulation as it relates to State Machines?

- Sub-state Machines don't rely on the states of the parent and vice versa

4. What does this state do?
'(Up)Base Layer'

- Provides a way of calling up to the parent State-Machine

5. How do you refactor nodes "New State 0, 1 and 2" from "Base Layer" into a child "New State Machine"

- Select B, C and D and drag them to A
