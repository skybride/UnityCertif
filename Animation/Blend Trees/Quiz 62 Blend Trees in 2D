Quiz 62 Blend Trees in 2D

Key Focus:
- types of 2D Blends
- manuvering left and right
- expanded on blend trees
- expanding on adding input

2D Blend Types:
- 2D Simple Directional -> strafe
- 2D Freeform Directional -> strafe
- 2D Freeform Cartesian -> adding left and right
- Direct -> tweak individually

In Animator -> click on 'Grounded' in Base layer -> From the Inspector change Blend Type: 2D Freeform Cartesian

1. Add in 6 more Motion Fields

Pos: X | Pos: Y
Idle: - 0 | 0
Walk: - 0.5 | 0
Run: - 1 | 0

StandQuarterTurnRight: - 0 | 0.5
WalkRight: - 0.5 | 0.5
RunRight: - 1 | 0.5

StandHalfTurnRight:- 0 | 1
WalkRightSharp: - 0.5 | 1
RunRightSharp: - 1 | 1

2. Add 6 more Motion Fields -> This will be for turning Left

StandQuarterTurnLeft: 0 |- 0.5
WalkLeft: 0.5 |- 0.5
RunLeft: 1 |- 0.5
StandHalfTurnLeft: 0 |- 0.1
WalkLeftSharp: 0.5 |- 0.1
