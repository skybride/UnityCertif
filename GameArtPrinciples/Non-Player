How to Import packages

Meshes: Made up of polygons -> Triangles

[Playing with Prefab]

- Via Inspector -> under Animator Component -> Select: Avatar

- Models folder will become available in the Project Section

- Select 'Avatar' 

- Via the Inspector -> Click on 'Configure Avatar' button

- Character will showcase skeleton. 

- Diagram will show pivot points

Checkout ModelRig Unity file for reference

[Comparing CPU and GPU bound games]

*Performance Bottlenecks
*optimizing model assets
*tips for optimizing characters

Factors that can affect performance of your game.

[CPU Bound Game]

CPU: Prepare frame #1|Prepare frame #2|Prepare frame #3
GPU: ... |Render frame #1...waiting|Render frame #2...waiting

1/ the time it takes for each frame = frame rate

NOTE: In a CPU Bound game CPU is Completely utilized -> GPU is not
To make this game run faster -> concentrate on optimizations that are less straining on CPU

[GPU Bound Game]

GPU: Render frame #1...waiting|Render frame #2...waiting
CPU: ...|Prepare frame #1|Prepare frame #2|Prepare frame #3

NOTE: GPU Renderers -> CPU assembles frame and then waits until GPU is done rendering next frame

Balancing the pipeline
(Reducing both GPU and CPU time)

[Types of Optimization to balance Pipeline]
Technique: Polygon Count : GPU : (Rule of Thumb) Mobile 300-1500, Desktop 1500-4000
Technique: Few Materials : CPU : (Rule of Thumb) No more than 2 per mesh
Technique: Few Bones :  CPU|GPU : (Rule of Thumb) Mobile: 15-30, Desktop: 15-60
Seperate Forward and Inverse Kinematics: CPU : N/A
Single 'skinned Mesh Renderer' : CPU : N/A
