Why Do We Have Concept Art?

- Creativity unconstrained by tools
- Quickly create multiple variants
- Allows artists to communicate ideas
- Ensures mood across multiple artists

NOTE: Try googling Concept Art in Google

How Art Choices Affect Mood
- Cartoon, photorealistic, dreamy...
- Hi-poly vs low-poly
- Flat vs complex materials
- High vs low resolution textures
- Foggy vs clear
- ambient light colour

Coulur Palette: Unifying Colour
- Ensure Colours will look pleasant
- Consistent with your desired mood
- Less 'noise' by limiting colours

Hue, Brightness and Saturation

Hue: Color
Brightness: Value (Darker / Lighter)
Saturation: Chroma (Vibrant / not vibrant aka white)

All these values affect the mood.

Analogous colours : Colours that fit together and compliment one another
ex: purple red orange -> gives warm feeling

Complementary colours: Opposite colors that clash but work well together
ex: green and red -> if game is mostly green use red to highlight important items to player
