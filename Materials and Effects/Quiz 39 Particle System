Quiz 39 Paricle System

1. The number of particles in a system reaches a steady state after a certain amount of time. If there is no maximum defined, which properties affecet this steady state

- Emission Rate and Lifetime

2. What dictates how the particle moves in the system?

- Velocity

3. An Emission Rate of 100 means

- Roughly 100 particles are emitted every second

4. How could the velocity of a particle be changed after it's born?

- By setting the Gravity Modifier

5. Name the effect applied here

- Custom Mesh

6. When would you use a gradient instead of a curve?

- Color over speed

7. Name the particle option used

- Color over Lifetime

8. Name the particle option used

- Size over Liftime - Random between 2 curves

9. I want my particles to rotate faster just before they die. I need to...

- Increase the value of the 'Angular Velocity' curve just before the end.

10. When can a Sub Emitter be created?

- When a particle collides with something

11. What is controlled by the curve in "Texture Sheet Animation"

- The animation frame

12. When rotation is specified in one dimension for a billboard particle, whih axis will the partile rotate about?

- Down the forward axis of the camera

13. Why would you 'prewarm' a particle system?

- So the system is in full swing when the sceen starts
