[Part 1]

KEY Focus:

- Albedo
- Metallic
- Smoothness
- Normal Map

NOTE: Remember to use Project Scene tab to filter Materials when using pre-made material assets (from the store)

Albedo: Base Color
Metallic: Plastic vs Metallic 
Smoothness: Dull vs Mirror 
Normal Map: Surface Detail

NOTE: All Materials can have a texture added -> via the square to the right of the dot

[Part 2]

Key Focus:

- Height Map
- Occlusion
- Emission
- Detail mask

Emission: Creates illusion /effect that the object is emitting light. (give glow)
Occlusion: Offers information for which areas are most likely to be in shadow 
	(not illuminated by light as strong)
Height map: Creates depth (without it object appears flat...gives an occulusion effect)
Detail mask: Secondary level of details (secondary maps) (Reducing size of texture)

[Part 3]

Key Focus:

- Specular standard shaders
- render mode properties (to achieve transparency effects)

Material Clarification:

Most important property that makes up a material is it's shader.

Shader: 
- A program that runs on the GPU instead of the CPU.
- It dictates how we can shade the surfaces of objects.
- Depending on which shader -> there will be different properties available

NOTE: An importan property is textures

Texture:
- can be made up of multiple materials like albedo, metallic, normal, height etc.

Standard Shade: is physically based

Specular shader is more traditonal (specular set up):
- for metallic for ex. -> in standard this is a property that can be adjusted. In specular smoothness will affect the metallic apperence instead
- Offers a tinge color to combine with albedo color

Transparent Mode: Affects the Alpha mode in albedo -> lets you adjust the value

NOTE: Use transparent for glass material objects, use fade for teleportation or ghost material objects

CutOut: Has an Alpha Cutoff that either gives an full opaque look or transparent. 
(Use for wires in grass for a game or fence behind a bus in a game)
(Can use as affects for dissolving in and out)
(More efficient that transparent)
