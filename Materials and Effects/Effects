1. Select Main Camera -> Add Component -> Image Effects.

Image Effects:
- Other
- Bloom and Glow*
- Blur
- Camera
- Color Adjustments
- Edge Detection
- Displacement
- Rendering
- Noise

[Bloom and Glow]
- Bloom
- BloomAndFlares(Deprecated)
- Bloom (Optimized)

NOTE: Add this Script and fiddle with adjustments

[Colour Adjustments]

1. Color Correction Curves -> Adjusts RGB

2. Color Correction 3D Lookup Texture -> uses a texture slices of a 3D cube -> Looks up color in RGB and maps one color to another

3. Color Correction Ramp -> (Ramp Texture) Less expressive

4. Tonemapping -> Use Techniques to make HD better on a LD Screen

5. Sepia -> Orangey hue

6. Gray Scale -> All gray

7. Contrast Stretch -> Setting high and low contrast bands (min/max)

8. Contrast Enhance -> Enhances Contrast slightly

NOTE: It adds a better color balance. More saturation

[Other]

1. Antialiasing -> Removes jagged edges

NOTE: Correct method for Antialiasing should be add via Quality Settings NOT on Camera. 

2. Screen Overlay -> Adds Texture on to screen as an effect

[Part 2]

[Blur]

1. Blur (optimized) -> Blur iterations, Downsample(less pixels)

2. Blur -> Adds Blur on an object

3. Motion Blur -> adding a trail (Needs a moving component), requires low frame rate

[Camera]

1. Camera Motion Blur -> Blur effect happens only when camera moves (slow exposure camera effect like in a racing car game)

2. Depth of Field -> Set focal distance (bits of visible that has blur around), focus on transform, forcal size, Aperture(greater aperture -> create a greater depth of field)

3. Tilt Shift -> (similar to depth of field) Only blurs top and bottom, or radial via blur area or max blur size, also has Downsample and Mode

4. Vignette and Chromatic Aberration -> (ex could be use for cut back scene) adds a black ring border around scene

NOTE: Vignette and Chromatic are lumped together but they are different affects

[Noise]

1. Noise and Grain -> On Play Mode grains move

2. Noise and Scratches -> Gives an old film affect on Play mode

[Displacement]

1. Fisheye -> fish's point of view (wide eye lens)

2. Twirl -> Twirl's image

3. Vortex -> Similar to twirl -> but has more control (ex impression of seasickness in a game)

[Edge Detection]

1. Crease Shading -> Borderlands type effect -> Not photo realistic but offers standing out -> You can adjust smoothness as well

2. Edge Detection -> You can leave only edges, similar to crease shading but you cannot adjust smoothness
