Shadow Effect Requirments:
- Shadow must be placed on 2 properties

1. the light itself
2. the GameObject

ex: Light|Sphere|Plane
1. Shadow on light which will create the shadow
2. The GameObject that will recieve the shadow is the Plane -> this is where the shadow will appear. NOT the Sphere. 

[On Plane Object Via Inspector]
1. Find Mesh Renderer: and check 'Recieve Shadows'
2. Cast Shadows: On

[On the Light Via Inspector]
1. Shadow Type: Hard Shadows (only in space)| Soft Shadows: and Adjust Strength

Try it OUT! Adjust the rotation...what happens to the shadow?

Shadow Acne: Happens when resolution is low -> stores some points incorrectly. 

Shadow Acne can be cured by Bias and Normal Bias

Bias: If low -> acne is worse. If High -> Shadow appears to be detached (Test it out by place sphere on the plane-> watch what happens when bias is tweaked. aka peter pan affect)

Normal Bias: If increased -> shadow gets less. If low shadow acne is still there
