[General GI] 
main setting that you'll be interested in is the directional mode.
In lightmaps you can store general direction that the ambient light is coming from. 
(specular shader will make use of this abilty to tell how much light to reflect back)

1. Non-Directional (stores no directional light information)
2. Directional (stores some directional light information)
3. Directional Specular (stores all information of light as if real time scene)
Increasing Realism and also Increasing memory
