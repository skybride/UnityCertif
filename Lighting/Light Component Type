Light Component Type


NOTE: Exam will require matching light icons to type of light

Understanding Light Reflections: Camera is where light comes in.

ex: Think  of Sun, Plant and Eye in real life.
In Unity Sun = Light source, Plant = GameObject, Eye = Camera

[Part 1]

Incident Light: Light source that hits Object

Diffuse Reflection: Light reflecion intensity based on angle

Specular Reflection: Mirrors the angle of Incident

Test it!

1. Create a material and change he Shader from 'Standard' to 'Standard (Specular)'
2. Increase Smoothness to a value of 1
3. Place on to a Sphere GameObject and Inspect Object at different angles.

Click on Directional Light:

[In the Inspector]

Color: Color of light being emitted
Intensity: Higher = Brighter

[Types of Lights]

Directional Light: Position does not affect light only rotation

Point Light: Has a sphere around it.

Spotlight: Cone shaped. Mix between Point and Directional, there is directionality and it is emitting from a point

Area Light: baked only

Reflection Probe: ??

Light Probe Group: ??

[Part 2]

Range: How far intensity spreads in unity units (meters unless changed)

Spot Angle: Width of bean

Culling Mask: Selectively lighting objects in a scene
How to use: Create a Sphere GameObject -> With it selected -> In the Inspector: Layer -> Select Add Layer -> Select User Layer 8 -> Type in 'Sunlight' -> Select Sphere via Hierarchy -> In Inspector: Layer -> Sunlight. Now selec Direcional Light via the hierarchy -> from the Inspector: Culling Mask -> Sunlight.
Directional light will only illuminate the Sphere instead of the entire scene.

Draw Halo: fuzzy globe of light aka a Halo of light

Flare|Sun: Similiar to a sun flare

Flare|50mmZoom: Similar to a camera lens

Cookies: Adding a texture (try GlassStainedAlbedo). Note GlassStainedAlbedo Texture Type must be set to Cookie to avoid an error in the console.

Cookie looks like a cut out placed in between the light source that adds a texture on to the object

ex. Light coming through blinds shining on to an object. Works on Spotlight not on Point Light
