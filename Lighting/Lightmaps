Lightmaps


Check out ARM Guide for Unity Developers
https://developer.arm.com/docs/100140/latest/introduction

Tip: Setup all lighting using pre computed real time GI -> and DISABLE Baked GI. You can see instant changes of Light.

Why is this important? For Optimization -> Less memory used. Faster Load times.

[Hierarchy + Lighting]

- Click on GameObject with the Lighting Tab instead of the Inspector showing.
- Click on Object Maps -> You will see Charts
- Charts: a collection of vertices (often in a square)

[Scene]

- Adjust from Shaded -> UV Charts.

Texels are mapped onto geometery of scene.

NOTE: Cubes that are stretched will have stretched texels. Which will cause optimization issues which is UV mapping

Preserve UVs: If there is already a UV unwrap use it. If uncheck we get to control the unwrapping

Auto UV Max Distance and Angle
