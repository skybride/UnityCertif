[Getting Global Illumination working]

Select all GameObjects the make up the dark room-> Static: Lightmap static, 
there will be a baking process. Let the scene build. Hit Play

[Baking]

Color Bleeding: Albedo color on GameObject when Globally Illuminated cast the same material color.

[In Lighting Tab]

Precomputed Realtime GI: You can move the lights. 

Baked GI: You cannot move the lights. Uses less resources, less GPU and CPU time and requires less memory -> Great for Mobile Platforms


[Baked GI]

Baked Resolution: texels per unit -> lights being calculated and baked in are being saved as textures.

NOTE: Texels per Unit value = How detailed. Better the quality -> longer bake time

[In the Scene Tab]
Find Shaded -> Baked

Final Gather: Don't Check until Scene is set up with Global Illumination -> Than when complete game or level check Final Gather

NOTE: You can uncheck 'Auto Generate' and manual select build when ready to avoid constantly waiting
